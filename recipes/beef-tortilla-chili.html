    <h2><strong>Chili season is upon us...</strong> and this hearty beef tortilla slow cooked chili recipe is an easy way to kick it off!</h2>
    <p><strong>Chili is always...</strong><em> at the top of my list when the weather cools and a chili recipe where a slow cooker does the work for me is even better!</em></p>
    <p><strong>I love how...</strong><em> hearty a good chili is and you can serve it so many different ways that leftovers are never a problem—ladled on hot dogs, spooned over baked potatoes, or just piled high in a bowl with toppings!</em></p>

    <li>2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the crispy tortilla strips (garnis):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>8 small tortilla corn tortillas, sliced into strips</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the garnish:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Sour cream</li>
    <li>Grated Cheese</li>
    <li>Chives</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Recipe Instructions:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Brown the beef: In a large skillet set over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Once it is hot, add ground beef and cook, breaking up the beef as it cooks, until beef is browned in spots, 7-8 minutes. Add onions, garlic, and spices and continue to cook for a few minutes to combine flavors. At the very end of browning, add beer or stock and use the liquid to scrape up any stuck bits from the skillet.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Add to the slow cooker: Transfer all the skillet ingredients to a slow cooker along with green chiles, beans, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Cover the chili and cook on high for four hours, stirring occasionally, or set to low for 8 hours.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Finish the chili: Season the chili with salt and pepper to taste once it has cooked. Serve it in big bowls garnished with cheese, sour cream, chives, and tortilla strips.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>To make the crispy corn strips: Preheat oven to 375 ̊F. Slice tortillas into strips and spread them out on a baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and spices and use your hands to mix together. Spread out in an even layer and bake the strips for 5-6 minutes. Then stir strips to make sure they are cooking evenly. The ones around the edges will cook faster. Bake for 4-5 minutes and then remove from oven and cool. Tortilla strips will continue to get crispy as they cool.</li>
